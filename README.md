# 🤔 Problem space

## Problems to solve/Requirements to Create

The problem in the software industry is that many company websites are overly complex, difficult to navigate, and lack engaging, user-friendly designs. Businesses need a platform that not only looks futuristic but is also intuitive and simple to explore.

### 👉 **Problem 1**: Current websites for software companies are outdated, overly complex, and often hard to navigate.

**Extended problem statement**: Many software company websites use outdated designs that are difficult to navigate and lack a modern user interface. The websites often have a cluttered, information-heavy layout that overwhelms visitors and fails to communicate the company’s vision clearly. This results in a poor user experience and a missed opportunity to attract potential clients or talent.

**Current solution**: Users often have to navigate through confusing menus, numerous links, and complicated layouts to find the information they need. Some websites attempt to simplify this, but often at the cost of modernity or engagement, leading to a balance that feels outdated or ineffective.

**How do we know it is a problem**:

- User feedback indicates frustration with websites that are hard to navigate and don’t reflect modern digital experiences.

- Metrics show that high bounce rates and low user engagement are common on sites with complex, outdated designs.

### 👉 **Problem 2**: Websites don’t reflect the forward-thinking, innovative nature of the companies they represent.

**Extended problem statement**: Many software company websites fail to showcase their cutting-edge technology and innovative spirit effectively. Their designs don’t reflect the exciting future-forward technologies they work with. This disconnect makes it harder for visitors to understand what the company truly represents and the value they provide in the industry.

**Current solution**: Users are left to infer a company’s innovative nature from limited information, outdated visuals, or inconsistent branding. This leads to a lack of excitement or inspiration for visitors and potential clients.

**How do we know it is a problem**:

- Through user surveys, we’ve found that people prefer engaging, futuristic websites that align with the latest design trends.

- Metrics show that potential clients are more likely to engage with websites that visually communicate modernity and innovation.

### 👉 **Problem 3**: Many websites fail to provide a smooth, fast, and responsive user experience across different devices.

**Extended problem statement**: In today’s digital world, users expect websites to load quickly and perform seamlessly, whether on mobile devices, tablets, or desktops. Websites that aren’t optimized for performance can frustrate users and result in them leaving the site before engaging with it.

**Current solution**: Many websites still use static, slow-loading content and lack mobile optimization. Users experience delays, poor interactivity, and frustration while navigating on different devices.

**How do we know it is a problem**:

- Analytics show slow page load times contribute to increased bounce rates.

- User testing confirms frustration when trying to access websites on mobile, especially those that aren’t responsive.

- **Reason 2**: As technology continues to evolve, it’s essential to adapt to new design trends, user expectations, and performance standards. Addressing these problems now ensures that LexoraTech stays relevant, attracts the right audience, and sets itself apart in an increasingly competitive market.

# Development Phase 

## Technology Stack Selection

### **1. Frontend -** Next.js

### **Why** Next.js?**

# Challenges Faced and Solutions 

### **Problem 1:** 

**Slow Initial Page Load**

- During early development, the homepage had slow loading times due to large image assets and unoptimized components, affecting the user experience.

### **Solution 1:**

1. **Image Optimization:**

   - Used Next.js `next/image` for automatic image optimization and responsive sizing.

   - Compressed images and converted them to `webp` format for smaller file sizes.

2. **Code Splitting:**

   - Applied dynamic imports and code splitting to ensure only essential code loaded on initial render.

3. **Lazy Loading:**

   - Implemented lazy loading for non-critical components like testimonials and service carousels to improve perceived performance.

### **Problem 2:** 

**Inconsistent Styling Across Pages**

- While using multiple UI libraries (Magic UI, Shadcn UI), the design started feeling inconsistent in terms of spacing, typography, and button styles.

### **Solution 2:**

1. **Design System Setup:**

   - Defined global design tokens (font sizes, spacing, colors) in Tailwind configuration.

   - Created reusable UI components using Shadcn UI and wrapped them with custom styles to fit the brand guidelines.

2. **Reusable Layout Components:**

   - Built layout wrappers (header, footer, and section containers) to maintain consistent padding and structure.
